# Spelling-dictionary
A spelling dictionary implementation using C++ programming language with self-implemented back-end data structures: hash tables and binary search trees. It was a part of the project made as a course team project for data structures course.
The team I worked with was consisted of me and two of my colleagues in faculty: Osama Fathy(Github: OsamaFathy), Omar Ibrahim(Github: om12ar).

Notes:
- The document named "Question 7" contains the description of the question and what is needed.
- the current model automatically reads more than 31000 words from the provided file "english words" and prompts the user continuously to input a string to search for in the dictionary and answers with "OK" if found or "not found" otherwise.
